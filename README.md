# Meme Supreme - SLO Hacks 2020
Meme Supreme is a simple game hacked together by freshman Cal Poly SLO students at SLO Hacks 2020! Have two people stand in the frame of the camera
and click "Start Round". The different memes will cycle through until somebody laughs. When they laugh (determined by Google's Machine Learning Vision API 0.o), 
the game will award the person a "laugh point". The first person to acquire five laugh points LOSES! Have fun! :)

Prebuilt binaries are available in the Releases section!
